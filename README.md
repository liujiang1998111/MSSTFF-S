1. The data is first preprocessed (available in the paper)
2. The processed data were fed into the CNE and BIGRU models to extract spatial and temporal features, respectively.
3. Processing using the SWA approach to improve model generalization.
4. Since the dataset is larger than 25 megabytes, the download link is given in the readme. https://www.zhaojunhua.org/dataset/IAID.
